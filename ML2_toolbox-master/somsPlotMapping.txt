We can choose, which categorial variable, should be represented in the mapping.
When mapping the winetype (red vs. white), we see, 
that the redwines are clusteres in the upper and lower left corner,
while the whitewines (with a bigger sample size) are spread through the neurons.

As it seems are the SOMs a good instrument in order to differentiate winetypes.
