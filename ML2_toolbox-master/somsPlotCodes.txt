    As we have a lot of nodes and variables, the codes plot is not easy to interpret.\n
    On the upper right, there property quality seems to hava a bigger impact.\n
    In the middle there seem to be a couple of nodes, which do not represent any particular feature. \n
    The nodes toward the lower left corner seem to have more alcohol.\n
    Whereas the nodes on the bottom  right seem to have higher dioxide rates.\n
    With so many features and notes, it is advisable to use a heatmap to visualize the codes. \n
