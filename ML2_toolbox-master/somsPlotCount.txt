    Having a look on the number of observations per note, we find,\n
    that the observtions are not evenly distributed.\n
    Some  notes do have more than 30 observation, while other notes have less then 10. \n
    The bigger part of notes include 10-20 observations. So it seems we should take more than 20X20nodes.\n
    For the visual representation we leave it with this number of notes.\n
